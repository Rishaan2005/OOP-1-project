## Objective
Survive for as long as possible in this simple space shooter game! The captain aboard a space cruiser, currently passing through 
a never-ending asteroid belt, needs your help. You need to control the ship and maneuver it so that you avoid all asteroids! 
Don't worry about shooting. The crew aboard will take care of that for you. Complete this challenge and know that they will be
able to safely return home and complete their mission because of you.

**Note:** The game does not have a story mode or ending, it is an endless shooter, where you must survive as long as possible.
